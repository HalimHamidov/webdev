			<p class="justified">From the Gulistan Be not over much angry with thy slave; Treat him not unjustly, and pain not his feelings. True, thou mayst have bought him for ten direms; But 'twas not by thy power that he was created. There is a tradition of the Prophet--peace be upon him!--that on the day of the resurrection the greatest grief will be when the pious slave is carried to Paradise, and his worthless master is borne away to Hell.</p>
